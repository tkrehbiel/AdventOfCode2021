# Advent of Code 2021 Puzzles

Puzzle solutions for Advent of Code 2021 in both Golang and Kotlin.

I used the event to refine my Golang skills and learn Kotlin from scratch. I ended up with 43 stars out of 50 in December, so you won't find any award-winning fastest-greatest-best solutions here.

After the event was over, I built a framework to run the puzzles with more commonality and further refactored the code to reflect the new framework. (As opposed to starting each puzzle from a blank project.)
